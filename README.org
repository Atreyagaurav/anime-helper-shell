* Anime Helper Shell

Since I was tired of searching for different websites and different animes to watch. And wanted my player to remember what I watched without having to depend on yet another website.

I created this solution. It's not super useful, or the best, but it works fine for me.

* Usages
- Watch anime from online stream
- Download anime for offline watch
- Search anime from keywords
- Record list of watched anime


* Installation
Clone this repository. 

Install the requirements.

#+begin_src bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
#+end_src

Make the ~ggshell.py~ executable and then symlink it to ~/usr/local/bin~ or other ~bin~ directory. 

Be sure to edit the ~config.py~ to change the ~ext_media_command~ variable if you use other players than ~mpv~, and change the ~anime_dir~ to the place you want to store your anime.

By defaults it makes ~anime~ directory in your home and stores it there.
You can symlink your anime storage directory to home too.
